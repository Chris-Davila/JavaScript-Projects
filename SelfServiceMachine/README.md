## **Self Service Macine**

Project had CSS completed and a skeleton completed of the HTML code. I had to supply the JavaScript to allow for specific functionality.

The following is a list of functionality I implemented:

* I made the tiles stay selected once clicked and deselected once unclicked and have the quanity counter appear only when the item is selected
* Make the 'Order Details' pane show up only when an item is selected, and ensured that there can never be 0 or less of an item in the quantity
* Have the item and its quantity appear under the 'Item' Header in the 'Order Details' pane. Have the totals appear under the 'Total' header in the 'Order Details' pane with proper formatting.
* Have the Gran Total be the caluclated total of all the items prices times their quantities.

Note: The project was completed using JSvue
