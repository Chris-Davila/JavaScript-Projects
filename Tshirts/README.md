## **T-shirt Quote Generator**

Project had CSS completed and a skeleton completed of the HTML code. I had to supply the JavaScript to allow for specific functionality.

The following is a list of functionality I implemented:

* Made sure the Color and Quality blocks are selected by diplaying them as a blue color with white text and have the color toggle to another block if that specific block is selected
* Have the Quantity box be editable by using the up and down arrows within the box and have the selections apper as a drop down in the 'Style' selection box. 
* Have the picture of the shirt change based on the selected 'Style'.
* Make the 'Order Details' categories update when the user enters a different quantity, or color, or Style, etc...
* Have 'Total' calculate the total of the order with proper formatting
